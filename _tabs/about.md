Hi, I'm **Yashraj Kupekar**, a Computer Science undergraduate at **Scaler School of Technology, Bangalore**.

I'm fascinated by intelligent systems and spend most of my time exploring **machine learning, reinforcement learning, and AI agents**. Rather than just using libraries, I prefer implementing algorithms from scratch—it's the best way to truly understand what's happening under the hood.

## What I Do

My projects span a wide range, from **deep reinforcement learning** experiments and **data analysis** pipelines to **backend systems** and **LLM-based applications**. I believe that building things yourself, even if they already exist, is invaluable for developing deep intuition about how systems work.

## Why This Blog?

This blog is my space to document what I learn, share experiments that worked (and those that didn't), and explore ideas as I navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of computer science and AI. If you're interested in the **how** and **why** behind algorithms, or enjoy seeing things built from first principles, you might find something useful here.

## Let's Connect

You can find me on **[X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/yashraj_kupekar)**, where I share thoughts, updates, and interesting discoveries related to my work. I'm always happy to discuss ideas, collaborate, or just chat about AI and computer science.

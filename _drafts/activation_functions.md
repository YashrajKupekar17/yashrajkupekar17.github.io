description: different activation functions

First we discuss about the Unsupervised pretraining ,
Why did this made the traiining of deeplearning models plausible ?
This though gave rise to the development of different advancements in ML. With a thought that the reasons where these :
Better Optimizations 
Better Regularization
Better activation functions 
Better weight initialization tecniques .
And then we talked about Batch normalization
